# Giac, a free computer algebra system #

This repository provides a mirror for
[Giac](https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac.html).
It contains build scripts for compiling the C++ code to binaries (with Java, Android and iOS wrappers),
and to WebAssembly using [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) (also including a GWT wrapper).

The repository also includes a NodeJS port (https://www.npmjs.com/package/giac) that is no longer actively updated.

In case you want to share any feedback or bug reports please use [the Giac / XCAS forum](https://xcas.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/forum/).
